Front End Technologies

1. React Hooks
2. Ionic React
3. Svelte 3

Back End Technology

* Phoenix LiveView


React Hooks: We can now use React without classes, only using Functional components. My big motivation to learn React in 2019 was it now seems easier to use and to learn React (no more confusion with using classes and this).

Ionic React: I always has been interested to develop a mobile app as a personal project but since my time is limited, I didn't want to learn React Native. I tried to learn Ionic on the previous versions but Ionic was using Angular and I was quite lost with Angular.

Phoenix LiveView: If you don't want to write Front-end code, LiveView allows you to write all you code on the server. It uses websockets, to have some real-time interactions all written in Elixir. Liveview is using javascript to update the dom, but you don't have to write Javascript to update the DOM. You update the state on the Server side, and Liveview automatically the DOM. For some advanced user interactions like drag and drop, you can easily add some javascript for those interactions.
